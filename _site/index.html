        <h2>
        This year on Mozia, the team of archaeologists led by Dr. Sconzo excavated the pottery workshop located in area K, as well as in three areas of the Necropolis. Dr. Jason Herrmann, from the Univerity of Pennsylvania, along with myself and PhD student Eric Hubbard, continued to geophysically survey the island's vineyards using magnetic gradiometry; <a target="_blank" href="https://jasonherrmann.wordpress.com/research/motya-sicily/"><u>this</u></a> is an ongoing project that Dr. Herrmann and Dr. Sconzo have been working on together for many years. <br></br>
        I was incredibly lucky to work on this dig as an assistant to Dr. Herrmann, and luckier yet to have met so many wonderful and hardworking people. Along with the geophysical survey of the vineyards, I worked on tasks related to GIScience and 3D visualization, such as the day-to-day mapping and photogrammetic documentation of the excavated areas and features inside them. Having received a summer fellowship from the <a target="_blank" href="https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/"> <u>Price Lab at the University of Pennsylvania</u>,</a> I intended to use data from the excavation season to design my own project which combines the aforementioned GIScience / 3D visualization with web design. This website is the product of that intention. The homepage (which you are currently on) gives you an overview the project, a brief history of Mozia, and a description of the areas excavated this season. 
        <br></br>
        On the page linked above (<i>Il Forno</i>), you can experience the excavation of a kiln found in Area K through images, orthomosaics, and 3D models, while I explain how these assets were created, walk you through the excavation itself, and provide some information about kilns/pottery on the island. In the footer, you can find a page containing the final write up for the project, the acknowledgements, and a list of citations. In order to be open-source, this site has been made available as a <a><u>github repository</u>,</a> where you can access the code and any assets attached to the project.

        <h1 style="margin-right: 5vw; text-align: right;"><i>A Brief History of the Island</i></h1>
      <h2>
        Mozia lies just off the coast of Marsala, on the Northwestern tip of Sicily. It carries many names (Mozia, Motya, San Pantaleo, etc.) and a rich history going back to the 8th century BCE, when it was settled by the Phoenicians. By 650 BCE, Ancient Motya had grown into a prosperous trade city, protected by the Stagnone lagoon. The city contained "residential houses, sanctuaries, public buildings, a market area and industrial workshops," all of which were surrounded by an impressive fortification following the coastline. Around 409 BCE, Motya had fallen under the control of Carthage, and it became one of their most important commercial cities. In approximately 397 BCE, Dionysius of Syracuse successfully laid siege to the island, and, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.livius.org/sources/content/diodorus/the-fall-of-motya/"><u>Diodorus Siculus</u></a>, killed any surviving inhabitants. Carthage almost immediately regained possession of the island, but Motya never recovered its former importance. There is no written history describing what happened to the island after the siege, but there is archaeological evidence of Greek and Roman inhabitation in the following centuries. In the 11th century, Basilian monks settled on the island, giving it the name San Pantaleo. <br></br>
        Mozia is currently a winery run by the <i>Fondazione G. Whitaker</i>, but side-by-side the vineyards are ancient ruins, some of which are still being excavated today. In fact, there have been excavations on Mozia since the late 19th century, when the island was bought by Giuseppe Whitaker. He would be the first to study its archaeology, publishing a book on his findings in 1921. University led excavations began later in the 20th century. When you visit the island now, you can see artifacts on display in Museo Whitaker, like the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.museodimozia.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Giovinotto-683x1024.jpg"><u><i>Youth of Motya</i></u></a>, and check out the ruins as you walk around island. In the summer months there are active excavations like the one directed by Dr. Sconzo, among others.
