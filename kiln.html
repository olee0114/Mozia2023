      <h2>
        Mozia provides extensive archaeological evidence of the production of Phoenician and Punic pottery. In the north-east quarter of the island, four different potters' workshops have been identified. This includes one found by G. Whitaker near the North Gate, as well as a kiln excavated near a tower on the eastern side, another workshop excavated just south of the early cemeter, and the “Ker-ameikos” of Area K excavated by UNIPA in 1977-1994. Area K stands as a structural example of Punic industrial workshops during the 6th and 5th centuries BC. The UNIPA team uncovered a large inner courtyard surrounded by a mud-brick enclosure. There was a row of rooms at the rear, and attached to one was a staircase that led to some sort of upper floor or terrace. They found "deep rock-cut wells, stone vats, clay basins, pure clay deposits, rows of up turned Punic amphoras, unbaked pots and loom-weights, raw materials and other installations for clay levigation and vessel preparation." Moreover, two kilns were excavated and identified as being similar in structure to those of Phoenicia and Iron-Age Palestine: omega shaped with bilobate combustion chambers. It is near one of these larger kilns that this most recent kiln was found.
